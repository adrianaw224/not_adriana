<p> Howdy, my name is Adriana Guerrero. I am a student at <a href="https://www.tamu.edu/">Texas A&M University</a>. This site has been created as part of an assignment for one of my horticulture clases: "Sociohorticulture". My service topic was community gardening. On December 3, 2022, I got the opportunity to volunteer at the <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/dir/37.09024,-95.712891/1703+E+29th+St,+Bryan,+TX+77802/@33.8541579,-98.6924,7z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m9!4m8!1m1!4e1!1m5!1m1!1s0x8646817085549fcf:0xcba894b8a0ffc0e5!2m2!1d-96.357821!2d30.6608461"> Serenity Healing Gardens</a> at the Texas Avenue Medical Clinic.

<p>
<b>Description of the activities you performed:</b>
During my time here I revitalized  a community gardening area by pulling weeds, trimming and removing dead plants, and adding a layer of mulch.
</p>
<p>
<b>How did your experience demonstrate the connection between people and plants? What specific type of economic, environmental, and well-being benefits did you and others experience through this event/experience?</b>

Being surrounded by trees, people, and such a beautiful landscape was quite calming. It also gave me a sense of camaraderie with others who care about the environment and want to raise awareness of environmental issues. Furthermore, reviving this communal garden improved the neighborhood's social and economic conditions and the quality of the environment.
</p>
<p>
<b>What did you personally gain from this experience? Did this experience impact you on a personal level?</b>

This experience gave me a sense of purpose, a sense of community, and the opportunity to improve my social skills. In so many ways, this experience has made a huge impact on me. I don't really want to wake up early in the morning to volunteer, but I had such a great time I forgot I was even there. In a better frame of mind, I made new friends, and felt grateful that my time here could benefit so many people. It inspired me to continue volunteering beyond the classroom.
</p>
<p>
<b>Since you are receiving credit for this course being a Social and Behavioral Sciences elective, how did this experience affect your views of social and personal responsibilities?</b>
I got a sense of how significant your social and personality obligations are from the experience. Not everyone has the opportunity to volunteer their time, help others, or appreciate how one small gesture can have a significant impact. This knowledge gives me hope and motivates me to inspire others to take on meaningful roles within their social and personal responsibilities as well as the idea that we all have responsibilities that go beyond ourselves in our communities.
</p>
<p>
<b>Since you are receiving credit for this course being an International & Cultural Diversity approved course, did you experience any different cultural interactions? Did this experience impact your understanding of connectivity and diversity among socioeconomic and cultural groups?</b>
Being able to attend an event that was surrounded by so many residents of Bryan County helped me to appreciate how socially and economically diverse this region is. I was able to establish friends with an array of diverse racial and socioeconomic groups, and this helped me realize how interconnected we all are.
<p>
<b>How might your local action have had a global impact? What effect did your service learning experience have on your view on the global community, and your personal global awareness?</b>
I was made aware of how one action can have such a ripple effect by this event. As a result of the experience, I have gained a better understanding of the global community as well as how ecosystems and human societies are interconnected.
